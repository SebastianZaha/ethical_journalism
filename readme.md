# How to update the database

1. A file with the date & optionally the time of the advertising broadcast should be added to the db folder. Names of the products should be simply written one per line.

2. run `node index.js`

3. Open db.json and fill out the urls for unseen / new products as reported by the previous command, if any. 

4. run `node index.js` again to check all is ok

5. commit & pull request
